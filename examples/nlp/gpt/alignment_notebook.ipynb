The master node is responsible for accepting write requests and updating its own data, while the slave nodes are responsible for replicating the data from the master and serving read requests.\\n\\nIn this configuration, the master node is the only node that can make          changes to the data, while the slave nodes can only read the data and replicate it. This ensures that the data is consistent across all nodes and that there is no data loss in case of a failure of a single node.\\n\\nMaster-slave replication in NoSQL databases can be implemented using various technologies, such as Apache Cassandra, MongoDB, and Apache HBase. In each of these databases, the master-slave replication configuration can be set up using specific configuration options and parameters.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that master-slave replication is not a failover solution, as the failure of the master node will result in the loss of data until the node is brought back online. Therefore, it's important to have a proper disaster recovery plan in place to ensure that data is protected in case of a failure.\",  \"from\": \"Assistant\", \"label\": \"helpfulness:4,correctness:4,coherence:4,complexity:3,verbosity:2\"}\n",
